## Next Steps

### For Joyce & Travis Abel

1. **Review all three documents** (VALUE_PROPOSITION, SMART_GOALS, TECHNICAL_ARCHITECTURE)
2. **Validate assumptions**:
   - Are client numbers accurate? (275 vs. actual count)
   - Are revenue estimates correct? ($800-900 avg commission/client)
   - Are goals realistic and achievable?
3. **Prioritize initiatives**:
   - Which short-term goals are most important?
   - Which technology investments should come first?
4. **Schedule EZLynx demo**: Contact EZLynx sales (877-372-8371)
5. **Optimize Google Business Profile**: Immediate free action with high ROI
6. **Launch review collection**: Target 50+ Google reviews in 90 days
7. **Set up monthly business review meeting**: Track progress against goals
8. **Begin CSR hiring process**: Post job listing for part-time customer service

### Questions to Consider

1. Is the $750/month technology budget acceptable?
2. Is the 42% revenue growth target (2025) aggressive or conservative?
3. Should we pursue geographic expansion (Weston/Elkins) or focus on Buckhannon dominance?
4. What's our appetite for commercial lines growth? (15-20 policies in 2025)
5. When should we hire the first CSR? (Mid-2025 or sooner?)
