# Abel Insurance Group - Value Proposition & Positioning

## Value Proposition

**"Abel Insurance Group is Buckhannon's trusted neighbor, delivering personalized insurance protection through true choice—representing multiple carriers to find the perfect coverage while providing hands-on claims advocacy that big insurance companies simply can't match."**

## Elevator Pitch

When West Virginia storms damage your home or you're left stranded after an accident, you don't want a 1-800 number—you want Joyce or Travis Abel, your local insurance advocates who know your name, understand Upshur County's unique risks, and fight for you with the insurance companies. As an independent agency, we represent 8-10 top carriers, so we shop for you instead of locking you into one company's rates. We're not just selling policies; we're protecting our neighbors, because this is our community too.
